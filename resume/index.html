	<div><h2>About Me</h2>
		
		<p>I have been writing about sports since my sophomore year of college, covering men's lacrosse and women's hockey for <i>The Cynic</i>, the University of Vermont's student newspaper.</p>
		<p>After transferring to Arizona State University for my junior year in 2007, I was offered an opportunity to be a founding editor for House of Sparky, a brand new ASU sports website on the <a href="http://www.sbnation.com">SB Nation network of blogs</a>.</p>
		<p>House of Sparky launched in 2008, and I quickly found himself immersed in the endless potential of sports journalism. Within months, House of Sparky was given media credentials for sporting events by the ASU media relations department, and I took full advantage.</p>
		<p>Since 2008, I've covered the Pac-10 Tournament in Los Angeles. I've sat in the press box at the Rose Bowl for an ASU game. I sat on the sidelines during the Sweet 16 and Elite 8 at the University of Phoenix Stadium in Glendale. I covered the 2011 Fiesta Bowl. It has been one hell of a ride.</p>
		<p>During my time at House of Sparky, I've also contributed many articles to SB Nation Arizona, a regional site that covered a broader swath of Arizona sports. It was during this time that I was credentialed for Arizona Diamondbacks, Arizona Rattlers and Phoenix Suns events.</p>
		<p>Some of my finest work was written for SB Nation Arizona, where there was less emphasis on fan-driven blogging and more interest in delving deep into new territory.</p>
		<p>One story was about Cory Hahn,<a href="http://arizona.sbnation.com/2011/2/22/2009480/cory-hahn-serious-neck-injury-puts-melodrama-in-perspective"> an ASU baseball player who was tragically paralyzed</a> on a slide into second base during his freshman season. I felt at the time that sports media was too focused on professional theatrics and did not focus enough attention on the sorrow facing Hahn.</p>
		<p>I also went in-depth with the Diamondbacks in 2011, and discovered <a href="http://arizona.sbnation.com/arizona-diamondbacks/2011/4/11/2103125/fight-of-arizona-diamondbacks-why-grit-actually-matters-in-2011">why grit actually matters </a>for a team that was breaking in a new manager, Kirk Gibson. As their subsequent playoff appearance proved, grit was a key factor.</p>
		<p>You can also find me as a freelance contributor to the Monumental Network, helping you find a <a href="http://www.monumentalnetwork.com/fans/washington-nationals-team-page/pregaming-at-nats-park">good watering hole near Nationals Park</a> or going into <a href="http://www.monumentalnetwork.com/fans/guys-night-out-at-verizon-center">great detail about my latest bromance</a>.</p>
